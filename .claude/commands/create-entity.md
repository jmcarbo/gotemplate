Create a new domain entity following Clean Architecture and SOLID principles.

Create a new domain entity called {{ENTITY_NAME}} with the following:
1. Entity struct in internal/domain/entities/
2. Constructor function following New{{ENTITY_NAME}} pattern
3. Business logic methods as needed
4. Comprehensive unit tests with table-driven test cases
5. Follow the existing patterns from user.go as reference
6. Include proper error handling and validation
7. Add repository interface in internal/domain/repositories/
8. Ensure the entity follows Single Responsibility Principle
