- **🧪 Comprehensive Testing** - Unit, integration, and template functionality tests
- **🐳 Docker Support** - Multi-stage builds and docker-compose for local development
- **🔧 Development Tools** - Pre-configured linting, formatting, and git hooks
- **📚 Rich Documentation** - Architecture guides, examples, and best practices
- **🤖 GitHub Actions** - CI/CD pipelines for testing, building, and releasing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Use this Template

1. Click the "Use this template" button on GitHub
2. Create your new repository
3. Clone and set up your project:

# Development
make run              # Run the application
make dev              # Run with hot reload
make build            # Build the binary
make test             # Run all tests
make lint             # Run linter
make fmt              # Format code

# Template Management
make template-check   # Check for template updates
make template-sync    # Sync with template updates

# Version Management
make version          # Show current version
make release          # Create a new release

# Docker
make docker-build     # Build Docker image
make docker-run       # Run in Docker
```

## 🧪 Testing

### For Template Users

Your project includes standard Go testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run benchmarks
make benchmark
```

### For Template Development

The template itself is thoroughly tested:

```bash
# Run local template test
./test/test_template.sh

# GitHub Actions runs comprehensive tests:
# - Code quality (lint, format, build)
# - Template instantiation (multiple scenarios)
# - Development workflow
# - Docker builds
# - Version management
# - Pre-commit hooks
# - Full integration tests
```

## 🔄 Keeping Your Project Updated

After creating your project, you can sync updates from the template:

```bash
# Check for updates
make template-check

# Preview changes
make template-sync-dry

# Apply updates
make template-sync
```

## 📋 Requirements
