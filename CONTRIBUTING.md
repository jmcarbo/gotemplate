   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Follow SOLID principles and Clean Architecture

3. **Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   make test-template
   
   # Run specific tests
   make test-instantiation
   make test-sync
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
   - Example: `feat(sync): add support for custom hooks`

5. **Submit Pull Request**
   - Update README.md if needed
   - Reference any relevant issues
   - Provide a clear description of changes

## Style Guidelines

### Go Code Style
- Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Document exported functions and types
- Handle errors explicitly

### Template Guidelines
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Keep the template generic and unopinionated
- Provide sensible defaults

### Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Project Structure

When adding new features, follow the existing structure:
- Configuration files go in the root directory
- Scripts go in `scripts/`
- Documentation goes in `docs/`
- Tests go in `test/`
- GitHub-specific files go in `.github/`

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Write integration tests for template features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for good test coverage

## Documentation

- Update relevant documentation
- Add examples for new features
- Keep documentation concise and clear
- Use proper markdown formatting
